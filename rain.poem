You find me offensive
I find you offensive for findin' me offensive
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
Cause it's getting expensive
Bein' on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths, this
Far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christo-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must of put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
